 still to be done
        add menu or toolbar:
            implement jogging - but only when not printing

        add a fans frame

        in Gcode constructor, extract from settings nextr, accel, fil diam, g28time, g29time

        add pause and resume, cancel, restart buttons to status frame

        when cancelling, wait for cancel to be performed

        get a better error message from printer status message when klippy_state is either shutdown or error


Done but not completed yet
        implement upload - done but unable to give file a new name


Down the road
        any other functionality I want to steal from fluidd
